                            When looking for hard-working and diligent employees, it's usually important to promote your company to the best of your ability. Why should employees come to your company rather than other companies? Better salary? Better benefits? Does your company treat its employees with respect?

                            In the Job Requirements section, it's generally advisable to mention the type of employee you're looking for. Do you want people with previous job experience? What type of education is required?

                            Clearly, there are many criteria in the Job Requirements; these are by no means the only ones. Writing a strong and enticing description requires some planning and structuring. Avoid spelling and grammatical mistakes, and proofread carefully. Finally, it is normally advisable to be concise! Certain employees are likely to view numerous job offerings, and they won't have the time to read numerous pages of information. (You probably wouldn't read this either if it was 500 pages....)

                            References are also an important part of a resume. Do you have any previous employers or other individuals which would recommend you? Are there any colleagues? If you're just finishing an university or high school education, are there any professors or teachers who would be willing to write references for you? How can the employer contact these people?
